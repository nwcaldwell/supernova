## Overview<a name = "Overview"/>

*Imagine a time 5 billion years in the future, when the lifetime of our sun is just winding down. All life in the solar system is in danger, for when a star's life ends it does so in a violent explosion. But there is hope! A wormhole exists just beyond Neptune that can transport our protagonist to a safer time and place. However, there is a catch. Our protagonist's vehicle only has enough fuel to travel into Mercury's orbit. There is only one-way out: he must use the gravity of each planet to propel himself to the next planet on his journey. Yet, there is danger in this approach. Meteors abound, and one wrong turn could bring our protagonist's journey to an untimely end. It is only through skillful navigation that he can reach his destination, and avoid the same wretched fate as the sun.*
